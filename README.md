# KnapsackAlgorithm

September 9:  KIRA 

After finally understanding the ins and outs of the knapsack algorithm, I began coding the actual algorithm. 
I went through the process of all the possible options and wrote out psuedo code, which allowed me to work out
some things with the creation of the table and how to format the algorithm to backtrack through it. Because I 
understood the process, the biggest problem that I had to overcome was learning the python code that
would support the algorithm. In a language I was more comfortable with, I could probably have finished it 
considerably faster, as I was forgetting how to do simple things like for loops.

I've submitted the final knapsack algorithm code. Overall, I've been testing the speed and it is not as good as
I would prefer, especially since I am currently only testing it with a smaller file size, when I would like it 
to be optimized enough to handle data sizes of up to around 1000. However, with the big O complexity, I am unsure 
of how you would go about creating a matrix at less than n^2 complexity, since a matrix in it's very definition
is n by n. I will continue to work on optimizing the structure.

After working on the generator for a bit, I've submitted a rough version of a generator that we can use to create 
bigger probelem sets so that our complexity can be tested at a higher and more strenous level to test the limits 
of our program. Unfortuantely, I was unable to find a solution that correctly used the newline character as a 
way to actually create a new line, instead of just prining out /n. I will continue to work on this.
